### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

> I can ensure my code, program, and/or software is functional and secure by adhering to customer requirements and best programming practices. Adhering to customer requirements ensures that I develop the program to the customer’s needs. I can further embellish on the logic and security of the program using best practices. In this project, I listened to my customer and ensured their requirements were met in the basic framework of the program. I used best programming practices to implement safeguards in character limit requirements and developed tools for unit testing.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

> I interpret user needs by first discussing the basic functions customers want their program to achieve in the initial meeting. I also retrieve what kinds of data they would like to instantiate, store, and manage. Then, these requirements become the blueprint of my program in the back end. I consider what users would like to see or be able to do with these layers in the frontend. This helps me incorporate user functions, navigation, and data access for users in the program.

## How do I approach designing software?

> My approach to designing software is similar to interpreting user needs and customer requirements. I develop the constructors, getters, and setters based on the customer’s data requirements. Then, I design the remainder of the program (i.e., functions, decision branching, logic, objects) based on the requested functions. I try to structure my logic from minimal to maximum screening requirements for decision branching so all known aspects of data are considered against the system’s accepted format.
